      <p>Instead of flowers we would like to suggest people make a donation to one of the following charities</p>
      <h2>Make a Wish</h2>
      <p>Lyn loved children with all her heart and <em>Make A Wish</em>'s goal of giving joy to children during a terrible time is something that would be a fitting tribute to her memory.</p>

      <h2>Marie Curie</h2>
      <p>We are so grateful to <em>Marie Curie</em> for supporting Lyn in her final days and making sure she was as 
        comfortable and peaceful as possible when the end came.
